	abstract = {The Open Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (OCARP) is an NP-hard arc routing problem where, given an undirected graph, the objective is to find the least cost set of routes that services all edges with positive demand (required edges). The routes are subjected to capacity constraints in relation to edge demands. The OCARP differs from the Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP) since OCARP does not consider a depot and routes are not constrained to form cycles. A hybrid genetic algorithm with feasibilization and local search procedures is proposed for the OCARP. Computational experiments conducted on a set of benchmark instances reveal that the proposed hybrid genetic algorithm achieved the best upper bounds for almost all instances.}

	abstract = {The Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP) consists of finding a set of minimum cost routes that service all the positive-demand edges of a given graph, subject to capacity restrictions. In this paper, we introduce some new valid inequalities for the CARP. We have designed and implemented a cutting plane algorithm for this problem based on these new inequalities and some other which were already known. Several identification algorithms have been developed for all these valid inequalities. This cutting plane algorithm has been applied to three sets of instances taken from the literature as well as to a new set of instances with real data, and the resulting lower bound was optimal in 47 out of the 87 instances tested. Furthermore, for all the instances tested, our algorithm outperformed all the existing lower bounding procedures for the CARP. Scope and Purpose In this paper, we present new developments in the Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP), which has many real-world applications. Examples include the routing of refuse collection vehicles, street sweepers, snow removal vehicles and many others. Due to the complexity of the CARP, it cannot be solved optimally except for very small size instances and a number of heuristic procedures have been proposed to solve the CARP approximately. Unfortunately, it is difficult to estimate the quality of a given heuristic solution for a CARP instance unless we know a tight lower bound on its optimal cost. In this paper, we develop a cutting plane algorithm to compute a lower bound for the CARP that outperforms all the existing lower bounding procedures. This algorithm has been applied to a collection of instances taken from the literature as well as to a new set of instances with real data, and the resulting lower bounds have proven that, for 47 out of the 87 instances tested, the previously known heuristic solutions were optimal.}

	abstract = {A well-known transformation by Pearn, Assad and Golden reduces a capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) into an equivalent capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). However, that transformation is regarded as unpractical, since an original instance with r required edges is turned into a CVRP over a complete graph with 3r+1 vertices. We propose a similar transformation that reduces this graph to 2r+1 vertices, with the additional restriction that a previously known set of r pairwise disconnected edges must belong to every solution. Using a recent branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm for the CVRP, we observed that it yields an effective way of attacking the CARP, being significantly better than the exact methods created specifically for that problem. Computational experiments obtained improved lower bounds for almost all open instances from the literature. Several such instances could be solved to optimality. Scope and purpose The scope of this paper is transforming arc routing problems into node routing problems. The paper shows that this approach can be effective and, in particular, that the original instances may generate node routing instances that behave as if the size is not increased. This result is obtained by slightly modifying the well-known transformation by Pearn, Assad and Golden from capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) to the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP), that is regarded as unpractical. The paper provides a computational experience using a recent branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm for the CVRP. The results are significantly better than the exact methods created specifically for that problem, improving lower bounds for almost all open instances from the literature. Several such instances could be solved to optimality.}

	abstract = {The urban waste collection problem and its disposal activities are among the most important municipal services involving many operational issues. In this paper, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model was developed for the multi-trip Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP) in order to minimize total cost. In the proposed model, depots and disposal facilities were located in different places. In order to validate the proposed model, several small-sized instances were solved by the CPLEX solver of GAMS software. Then, a hybrid algorithm using the Taguchi parameter design method was developed based on an improved Max-Min Ant System (IMMAS) to solve well-known test problems and large-sized instances. Computational results show high efficiency for the proposed algorithm.}

	abstract = {There have been several attempts to solve the capacitated arc routing problem with m vehicles starting their tours from a central node. The objective has been to minimize the total distance travelled. In the problem treated here we also have the fixed costs of the vehicles included in the objective function. A set of vehicle capacities with their respective costs are used. Thus the objective function becomes a combination of fixed and variable costs. The solution procedure consists of four phases. In the first phase, a Chinese or rural postman problem is solved depending on whether all or some of the arcs in the network demand service with the objective of minimizing the total distance travelled. It results in a tour called the giant tour. In the second phase, the giant tour is partitioned into single vehicle subtours feasible with respect to the constraints. A new network is constructed with the node set corresponding to the arcs of the giant tour and with the arc set consisting of the subtours of the giant tour. The arc costs include both the fixed and variable costs of the subtours. The third phase consists of solving the shortest path problem on this new network to result in the least cost set of subtours represented on the new network. In the last phase a postprocessor is applied to the solution to improve it. The procedure is repeated for different giant tours to improve the final solution. The problem is extended to the case where there can be upper bounds on the number of vehicles with given capacities using a branch and bound method. Extension to directed networks is given. Some computational results are reported.}

The procedure uses single vehicle moves and moves that operate on two routes, both derived from a node routing context but properly adapted to work well for arc routing problems. We combine the algorithm with the meta-heuristic guided local search and further use the mechanisms of neighbor lists and edge marking to improve the solution quality and to save computation time. Experiments on standard benchmark problems from the literature show that our algorithm outperforms the existing heuristics for the CARP. On a set of new test problems, the local search approach consistently produces high quality solutions and often detects an optimal solution within limited computation time.}
